### Purpose

When calculating metrics, there are occasions when certain taxa are not included
in taxa richness metrics but the individuals are included for all other metrics.
This is done to avoid double counting taxa that may have been identified to a 
coarser level when taxa of a finer level are present in the same sample. These 
taxa have been referred to by many names – e.g., non-distinct, redundant or 
ambiguous taxa.  Here we will use the term ‘redundant’. 

The table below shows examples of two taxa that are potentially redundant in a 
sample. Perlodidae and Glossosomatidae (family-level) are excluded from the 
richness metrics in this sample. The organisms identified as Perlodidae could be 
the same as those identified as Perlinodes aurea (species-level) or Skwala 
(genus-level), and those identified as Glossosomatidae could be the same as 
those identified as Glossosoma (genus-level). A detailed description of the 
process that the R tool uses for marking redundant taxa can be found here.

### Notes

Ensure that the taxonomic levels in your input file are complete and correct.

After you upload a file, you will receive a prompt asking if you would like to
consider all of the taxa levels that appear in your input file. You will have 
the opportunity to deselect levels if desired (just click on the taxa level in 
the box which will then become highlighted and hit delete).

The output file will include all the columns in the input file plus a new column
titled whatever you entered into the 'Output Column Name' field (default =
'Exclude'). It is a TRUE/FALSE field in which redundant taxa are marked as 
'TRUE'.  If you are planning to run the output file through the Metric 
Calculator, the column will need to be named 'Exclude'.

All 'Redundant' decisions are sample-specific. If sample contents change and/or 
if the level of effort or operational taxonomic units change, the input file 
should be rerun through the function.

A detailed description of the process that the R tool uses for marking redundant
taxa can be found here.


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shiny::a("Mark Redundant Decision Criteria"
         , href = file.path("linked_files"
                            , "MarkExcluded"
                            , "MarkRedundant_DecisionCriteria.docx"))
```

Click below to download an example input and output file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shiny::a("Example test files"
         , href = file.path("linked_files"
                            , "MarkExcluded"
                            , "MarkRedundant_ExampleFiles.zip"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shiny::a("Example script"
         , href = file.path("linked_files"
                            , "MarkExcluded"
                            , "BMT_MarkExcluded_Example1.R"))
```


If you prefer you run this function using R console instead of the Shiny app.

The R package is available for download on GitHub.  Use the green "Code" button.

To install from within R use the code below.
```{r install, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("leppott/BioMonTools", force=TRUE, build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
