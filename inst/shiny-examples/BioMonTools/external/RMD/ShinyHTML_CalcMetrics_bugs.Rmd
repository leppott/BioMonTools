```

### Purpose

This function calculates an assortment of biological metrics based on the 
traits/attributes in the input file. Column headings and attribute entries need 
to follow the naming convention specified below. For RMN analyses, attribute 
assignments should match with those in the appropriate regional traits table. 

Currently, the Shiny app is set up to calculate the following groups of benthic 
macroinvertebrate metrics:

* Standard bioassessment

* Major taxonomic groups

* Thermal and hydrologic indicators

* Functional feeding group (FFG)

* Habit

* Tolerance

* Life cycle/voltinism

* Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) attributes

Click below to see the list of available metrics.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shiny::a("Metric Names", href = "MetricNames.xlsx")
```

More metrics are available in the BioMonTools R package. You can request the 
addition of new metrics to the R package or Shiny app by emailing Erik (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) or posting your request on the BioMonTools GitHub 
page (https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools/discussions).

### Notes

* Upload a file under "Load Data".  The status bar will tell you when the upload
is complete.  Then return to this screen.

    +	Required fields: see table below

    + Important note: column names and entries must match the spelling and 
    symbology exactly as shown below (some column headings have underscores).

*	Click the ‘Run Function’ button; a status bar will appear in the lower right 
corner.

*	After the function is done running, the ‘Download Results’ button will be 
active. Click this button to retrieve your results.

*	Save the file in the desired folder. In the output (Excel) file, metrics will 
be grouped into worksheets based on the categories listed above.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
shiny::a("Example benthic macroinvertebrates Input File"
         , href = file.path("linked_files"
                            , "CalcMetrics"
                            , "BugMetricInput1.csv"))
```


### Additional Notes

*	If taxa are missing attribute assignments, either leave the entry blank or 
populate with ‘NA.’

*	Input file checklist for the RMNs –

    +	Remove any rows that have 0 individuals (e.g., Large/Rare taxa entries)

    +	For each taxon, there should only be one entry per sample. For example, if
    entries are broken out by life stage (e.g., larvae, pupae), they should be 
    ‘collapsed’ into one row per taxon/sample (by summing the individuals and 
    deleting the life stage field)

    +	Check the total number of individuals. Perform random subsampling if 
    needed. For example, if you want to apply a 100-count kick IBI but have a 
    300-count sample, first reduce the total count of individuals to 100.
